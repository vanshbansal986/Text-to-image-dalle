# ðŸŽ¨ AI Generation Hub

AI Generation Hub is a Streamlit-based web application that leverages the power of OpenAI's DALL-E 3 and Hugging Face models to perform various AI-powered tasks, including text-to-image generation and image-to-text conversion.

## Features

- **Text to Image Generation (DALL-E)**: Generate images from text prompts using OpenAI's DALL-E 3 model.
  - Customizable image size, quality, and style.
- **Text to Image Generation (Stable Diffusion)**: Create images from text descriptions using the Stable Diffusion model.
  - Adjustable resolution and quality settings. Did not work because server couldnt handle the load.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
 

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
